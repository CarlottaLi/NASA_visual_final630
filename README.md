This is a webpage that integrates two visualization sections, where the data is collected from the public API given by NASA officials.

To see the webpage, download the file and go to the Final.html.

The first one tells details about meteorite landings from the Meteorite Society and for interaction, you can double click and drag the picture to discover the specific location.

The second section focuses on global precipitation change discovered by TRMM Microwave Imager satellite. The visualization allows you to freely drag or zoom the timeline slider below to see the precipitation change in different time periods.
